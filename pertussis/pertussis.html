        <p>Pertussis, historically known as whooping cough, is a very serious respiratory infection caused by the
          pertussis bacteria. It can cause violent coughing fits. Whooping cough is most harmful for young babies and
          can be deadly.
          <br> <br>

              <br><br> "Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella Pertussis. When an infected
              person coughs or sneezes, tiny germ-laden droplets are sprayed into the air and breathed into the lungs of
              anyone who happens to be nearby."

              <br><br> "Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe.
              After cough fits, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breaths, which result in a “whooping”
              sound. Pertussis can affect people of all ages, but can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than

          <p>Pertussis outbreaks occur every 3-5 years, as can clearly be seen above. There is a huge spike

            data on kindergarten vaccination rates by school, sorted by county. County data, then, became easy to

            Initially, only county population data over time was extracted from the US Census Bureau API. With the
            second iteration, however, an
            additional 75 columns of data was pulled for each California county for every year between 2010 and 2016.
            These were processed down to the following items:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>County name</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Total county population</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Percent of population that was foreign born</strong> - Is it possible that people originally
                from foreign countries travel back to those countries more often
                and are thus more likely to spread pertussis?</li>
              <li><strong>Percent of population that moved from overseas in the past year</strong> - Do people moving
                from overseas (either returning or immigrating to the US) have a tendency to bring
                pertussis with them?</li>
              <li><strong>Percent of women ages 15-50 who had given birth in the previous year</strong> - This measure
                was considered because it is common for obstetricians to
                encourage pregnant women to get immunized against pertussis in their third trimester, some of whom <a
                  href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/protection.html">encourage their families and friends
                  to get immunized</a> as well (cocooning).</li>
              <li><strong>Percent of population that was school aged</strong> (3- to 17-years-old) - It was worth
                considering if a large school-aged population made it more likely for a
                county to experience an outbreak because so many children were in close proximity to one another, or if
                it was less likely because children are required to be immunized to attend school.</li>
              <li><strong>Average household size</strong> - Does higher household size lead to an increased spread of
                disease, and hence a higher likelihood of an outbreak?</li>
              <li><strong>Percent of school-aged population not enrolled in public or private school</strong> - This
                measure is being used as a proxy for students ages 3-17 who are homeschooled.

                play a role in the spread of pertussis, in particular at schools? It is possible that social programs
                make it more likely for low-income students to have access to immunizations. It's also possible that
                <a href="http://money.com/money/5641663/anti-vaccine-rich-people/"> wealthy families are more likely to
                  resist immunization or to have the ability to opt out from vaccinations</a>, whether legal/ethical or

            correlation to the outbreak percentage. A linear regression was run on each of these features to glean additional information.

                  <strong>Figure 6</strong> - Linear Regression plot of training data vs predicted
                  <br><br>
                  Predicted line has a shallow slope that shows a decreasing pertussis outbreak rate as the vaccination
                  rate
                  increases.
                  Looking at the distribution of the training data plotted we can infer that the correlation between
                  vaccination
                  rate and pertussis cases is not very strong.

                  The plot shows that the higher the threshold set is to determine the greater the accuracy of the
                  model. Based
                  on the plot, we selected 10 as the threshold to run our logistic regression on.

                  Because the scatter plot of the linear regression seems to show a clusters of low incident and high
                  incident,
                  we decided to also do a logistic regression to predict outbreak vs. no outbreak.
                  The plot of the regression data shows a higher probability of no outbreak as the vaccination rate
                  increases,
                  which is what we expected.

                    Looking at the Tableau visualization (Figures 3 & 4 above) we could visually see that there is a cyclical nature to the outbreaks. We opted to 
                    further explore this pattern and found a correlation between the time in years since the last outbreak and future outbreaks.

                  When we visualized the linear regression for foreign born population in each county against accuracy, we found minimal influence on the 
                  accuracy of the model, as can be seen by the near-zero slope of the regression line.

                  The probability does not vary widely over the entire range of the population percentages, which demonstrates the weak correlation in Figure 10.

                  We can see in the above graph that the percentage of the population in all counties that moved from overseas is less than 2%, which is likely why this 
                  feature has a weak correlation.

                  This feature is one of the stronger indicators that we found in our analysis, as can be seen in the chart above. The fact that it is a negative correlation is interesting, 
                  and provides some evidence of our speculations potentially being correct.

                  The wider range of probabilities over the percentage of kids from low-poverty households strengthens the correlation.

          <p>Factors that prevented a stronger model for predicting Pertussis outbreaks:
            <ul>
              <li>We used kindergarten vaccination rates as representing the overall vaccination rate for each county’s
                population. This does not account for those who relocated to counties after kindergarten age.</li>
              <li>Immunity from either vaccination or having Pertussis is not life-long. This also weakens the use of
                kindergarten vaccination rate as representative of the general population.</li>
              <li>Year to year changes in kindergarten vaccination rates only relates to a small portion of the
                population and does not reflect the same amount of change in the general population vaccination rate.
              </li>
              <li>Access to additional datasets limited the model. Additional potential factors could include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Population density of county or biggest city in county.</li>
                  <li>Proximity to international airport and number of flights to countries affected by pertussis.</li>
                  <li>Number of adults who work outside the home versus from the home.</li>
                  <li>Vaccination rates for general population.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            As we added more features to our logistic regression, our data set lost a span of data point by a significant amount. 
            We went from a 16 year span in our initial single feature linear regression to six years in our final model due to the limitation of data availability. 
            While we did find other features with a notable correlation that would strengthen our ability to predict an outbreak, we lost nearly two thirds of our yearly data, weakening our model. 
            Thus, an inherent problem in data science - the limitation of data.

              <strong>A parting thought…</strong> 
              <br><br>
                When parents chose to not vaccinate their child, they place at greater risk persons who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, those who are too young to be fully vaccinated, and others for whom vaccines do not provide complete protection.
